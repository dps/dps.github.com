On my latest trip to San Francisco, I was privileged to be able to drop in to theÂ <a href="http://www.dodocase.com/" target="_blank">DODOcase</a> factory and got a guided tour from chief DODO - <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/patrickreganbuckley" target="_blank">Patrick</a>. DODOcase use traditional bookbinding techniques (at a long-established local book binder) to produce a really neat book-like case for iPad and Kindle 3.

Patrick gave me a tour of their production facilities. In addition to the local book binder, they work with a nearby workshop which employs disabled San Franciscans who build the DODOcase frames by hand and attach them to the outers made at the book binder. It was impressive to see how DODOcase is helping provide work for their local community while turning out a top-quality product.
