I love reading on my Kindle, but as anyone who has been using one for a while knows, it feels too delicate to drop straight into a bag and really needs a case. So, I need a case, but I want one that actually makes the Kindle look like a book - enough to make the person sitting opposite me on the tube take no notice of my fancy e-reader and prevent cabin crew bothering me to turn it "off" for take off and landing. So it's going to need to have edges that look like pages and be book shaped... I thought, <a href="http://blog.davidsingleton.org/kindle">why not start with a real book and hack it to perfectly cradle a Kindle</a>

...and thus went my weekend.  But, after two days of hacking, I've written it all up <a href="http://blog.davidsingleton.org/kindle" target="_blank">here</a>
